Running SQL queries using python on the popular Chinook database from SQLite

Answering some business questions for a fictional digital music shop (Chinook).
The Chinook database contains information about the artists, songs, and albums from the music shop, as well as information on the shop's employees, customers, and the customers purchases. This information is contained in eleven tables.

Some questions to answer:
-  Break-up of sales by genre in USA (the biggest market)
-  Sales break-up by country
-  Which artist is used in the most playlists?
-  How many tracks have been purchased vs not purchased?
-  Is the range of tracks in the store reflective of their sales popularity?
-  Do protected vs non-protected media types have an effect on popularity?
